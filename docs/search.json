    "text": "Introduction:\nIn this blog post, I will be looking at breweries across the United States. This data set is a csv file I got from my data folder from my Stat-234 class from last spring. Breweries vary in their type and region so those will be the variables I will look at. In this analysis I will look at the distribution of breweries across the United States while also looking at the distribution of different types. My main question will be: How do brewery counts and brewery types differ across U.S. states?\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n# Clean data and create a count\nbreweries &lt;- read_csv(here::here(\"data/breweries.csv\"))\n\nRows: 2407 Columns: 6\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (5): brewery_name, type, address, website, state\ndbl (1): state_breweries\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nbrew_count &lt;- breweries %&gt;%\n  group_by(state) %&gt;%\n  mutate(state = str_replace_all(state, \"-\", \" \")) %&gt;%\n  summarize(total_breweries = n()\n            )\n\n\n# load map data and join\nstates_map &lt;- map_data(\"state\")\nmap_df &lt;- states_map %&gt;%\n  left_join(brew_count, by = c(\"region\" = \"state\"))\n\n\n\nFigure 1.

A small number of states, particularly on the West Coast, in parts of the Northeast, and in Texas, show much higher concentrations of breweries compared to other regions. We can see that the west coast is the most heavily concentrated, along with Colorado.\n\n# top 10 states in breweries\nt10_state &lt;- brew_count %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(total_breweries)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:10) %&gt;%\n  mutate(state = fct_reorder(state,total_breweries))\n\n\n\nFigure 2.

As we can see, the western states are leading the pack like we discussed above after looking at the map.\n\n\nFigure 3. Grouped bar chart showing distribution of brewery types across the top 10 states\n\n# Clean data so we only have top 10 states and the top 3 types of breweries\nbreweries %&gt;%\n  filter(state %in% c(\"california\",\"colorado\",\"oregon\", \"washington\",\"newyork\",\"pennsylvania\",\"florida\",\"michigan\",\"texas\",\"wisconsin\")) %&gt;%\n  filter(type %in% c(\"Microbrewery\", \"Brewpub\",\"ContractBrewery\")) %&gt;%\n  count(state, type)%&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = state, y = n, fill = type)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Distribution of Brewery Types Across the Top 10 States\",\n       subtitle = \"Top 3 types of breweries\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis grouped bar chart compares the number of brewpubs, microbreweries, and contract breweries across the top 10 U.S. states by total brewery count. Brewpubs are the most common brewery type in every state shown, while microbreweries consistently make up the second-largest share and contract breweries remain relatively rare. Although total brewery counts vary by state, the overall composition of brewery types is pretty consistent across these top states.\n\n\nConclusion:\nThis analysis shows that there are geographic patterns in the distribution of breweries across the United States, with higher concentration in states such as California, Colorado, and parts of the northeast. Looking beyond location, we can also see that Brew pubs dominate the industry. This suggests that producers prefer a brewery that is restaurant based and offers food rather than a brewery that just offers beer. This makes sense because people like to eat food while they drink beer, so this is most likely the most profitable avenue. I did encounter some limitations in my analysis. The type of brewery was not the cleanest, hence why I had to filter by the top 3 types. This was for time sake purposes. There were also some variables that were not useful and the amount of variables were limited. With additional data or more time, I would try to incorporate population, breweries per capita, climate, and proximity to resources. I feel like these variables could provide more insight.\n\n\nConnection to Class:\nThis project uses concepts from class, specifically using visuals to provide deeper understanding. Rather than relying on summary statistics alone, visualizations such as choropleth maps and bar charts are used to reveal patterns, variation, and concentration in the data. These visuals make it easier to identify regional patterns and differences in brewery types that would be difficult to observe from a table of counts."

    "text": "Introduction:\nThe NFL MVP award is one of the highest achievements a professional football player can receive. The NFL MVP is decided by 50 media members (sports writers and broadcasters) all selected by the Associated Press. Although non-quarterbacks can win, it does not happen often. In this analysis, we looked at just quarterbacks so it was easier to compare. One of the most influential statistics used to measure a quarterbacks performance is QBR. QBR is a very complex statistics to calculate, so in this analysis we will not be using it but we will use variables that are used to calculate QBR. In this analysis we will use total season yards, touchdowns, expected points added (EPA), and season completion percentage to look at what quarterback is deserving of the MVP. For our data, we used a package called “nflverse” which includes a large amount of data from the NFL. The subset of data from this package that we used was called player_stats which gave us each player’s individual game stats for each week of the 2025 NFL season.\n\nlibrary(nflverse) \n\nWarning: package 'nflverse' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching packages ──────────────────────────────────────── nflverse 1.0.3 ──\n\n\n✔ nflfastR 5.1.0     ✔ nflreadr 1.5.0\n✔ nflseedR 2.0.2     ✔ nflplotR 1.6.0\n✔ nfl4th   1.0.4     \n\n\nWarning: package 'nflfastR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'nflseedR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'nfl4th' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'nflreadr' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\nWarning: package 'nflplotR' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── Ready to go! ──\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.4.3\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n\n\n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n\nstat_df &lt;- load_player_stats()\n\n# Need to clean data so we only have QBs in the 2025 regular season\nnfl_stat_clean &lt;- stat_df %&gt;%\n  filter(position == \"QB\",\n         season_type == \"REG\",\n         season == \"2025\") %&gt;%\n# Need to select variables that will be used in analysis.

Matthew Stafford, Drake Maye, Josh Allen, and Trevor Lawrence. The color scale is sequential, so QBs with more touchdowns will have a brighter point. Matthew Stafford leads the league significantly in touchdowns while Drake Maye leads the league in yards. As we can see, there is a postive correlation with total yards and total touchdowns but it is not perfect. Although Maye leads in yards, Stafford is not far behind and has significantly more touchdowns than Maye, showing that he produced more scores for his team. If we were looking at just these two stats, then Stafford would be considered a more deserving candidate for the MVP.\n\n\nFigure 2. Top 10 QBs in Completion % in 2025\n\n# slice and filter to see top 10 Qbs in completion %\nt10_cmppct &lt;- season_stats %&gt;%\n  filter(total_att &gt;= 238)%&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(completion_pct)) %&gt;%\n  slice(1:10) %&gt;%\n  mutate(player_name = fct_reorder(player_name,completion_pct))\n\n# Make Lolliplop plot\nggplot(t10_cmppct, aes(x = player_name,y = completion_pct)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = player_name, y = 0, yend =  completion_pct\n                   ),\n               color = \"red\") +\n                 geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Top 10 NFL QBs in Completion % in 2025\",\n       x = \"Player Name\" ,\n       y =\"Completion %\" )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at our lolliplop plot, we can see that the top 10 QBs in completion % are all pretty close. What is interesting about this plot is that Stafford is not in the top 10, while Maye leads the league. As we saw in our scatterplot before, Stafford was clearly an outlier in offensive production. This makes it harder to distinguish who is deserving of the MVP. Maye is at the top of both plots while Stafford is only at the top of one. This is where the award voters have to weigh each statistic and look at what it truly means to be an MVP.\n\n\nFigure 3. Column Chart of QB’s season EPA\n\n# Make a column chart showing every eligible QB's EPA for the entire season.\nseason_stats %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(season_epa)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(player_name = fct_reorder(player_name,season_epa)) %&gt;%\nggplot(.,aes(x = player_name, y = season_epa)) +\n  geom_col(aes(fill = season_epa)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_fill_distiller(type = \"div\", palette = \"RdBu\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis column chart ranks each eligible NFL QB based on their season EPA. It ranks from top to bottom, top being the highest, bottom being the lowest. The color scale also correlates with season EPA, red being higher, white in the middle, blue being lower. EPA measures how much each play increases or decreases the offense’s expected points compared to before the play. It essentially tells us how much a player contributes to scoring, but also how efficient they are. It captures efficiency and situational value rather than raw production. Loooking at the chart, we can see that Drake Maye leads pretty substantially. Looking at players we have seen in previous plots, we can see that Stafford is third, and Josh Allen is fourth.\n\n\nConclusion:\nAfter looking at these three figures, we can see that the top 2 candidates for the MVP are Drake Maye and Matthew Stafford. They are both very productive players and add significant value to their teams. If I were an award voter, and was basing my pick on just the figures presented here, my first place pick would be Drake Maye. He was 1st in 2 out of the 3 figures and was right at the top of the scatterplot. Although the statistics we looked at are significant in MVP decision making, they are not the only factors that go into who wins the award. Like I mentioned earlier, we were not able to look at QBR or calculate it which is a huge deciding statistic. We also didnt look at overall team performance, or who had better “offensive weapons”. If I had more time and additional data, I would look at QBR, overall team performance, include non QB players, and also consider the voting system in which the 50 media members use which is a 5 player rank. I think that these factors could significantly change how we look at the top candidates for the NFL MVP.\n\n\nConnection to Class:\nIn the first few weeks of class, we have discussed what makes a figure effective, more appealing, and easy to read/interpret. In the first figure which was the scatterplot, I wanted the reader to be able to see who had the highest raw amount of offense. I used a sequential color scale like we talked about in class to highlight the significance of touchdowns. I also added text so the reader could see what player corresponded to each point. The second figure was simple but effective. In class, we talked about how sometimes simplicity is better because it can be easier to interpret. I think the lolliplop plot was a perfect figure for ranking players based on a numerical variable, specifically completion percentage. Lastly, the third plot put it all together. We used a column chart to rank a categorical variable based on a numerical variable, in this case, season EPA. We then used a diverging color scale because we had values that were on both sides of zero. The color scale makes it easier for the reader to interpret and also has an appealing look to it.\n\n\nPartner:\nBaxter Lowell"
